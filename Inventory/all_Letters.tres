11:34 p.m., April 14
A man rushed in the town hall screaming for help, he looked terrified and repeatedly said \"What I saw... it can't be anything good. It can't be of this world!\". After a few minutes we barely manage to calm him down and get him to tell us more about his situation. The only thing we could make out from everything he said was that we needed to explore the sorrounding area of the Díaz hacienda. We decide that it will be best if we investigate the area in that exact moment. Meanwhile, we get a medic to check on the man, he seems out of his mind.

4:21 a.m., April 15
When we arrived at the Díaz hacienda, we were greeted by the head of the family, as if he was already expecting our visit. Right when I was about to explain the situation and the purpose of our visit, he beckoned one of his henchman to lead the way for what we were looking for. After 15 minutes of walking, we find the scene described by the man that entered the ayuntamiento. There are some glyphs that none of us had seen before, and these seen to have been made with someones blood. While my partner inspects the area, I try interrogating the henchman, but I get no answer from him, not even a single reaction. A couple of minutes later, we head back to the ayuntamiento, not without trying to talk with the head of the Díaz family. Unsurprisingly, the henchman won't let us through, so we give up and just head back.

6:53 a.m., April 15
After searching for ours, we found the body of the man in a hole at the outskirts of the town. With it, we find a message saying \"Stop looking for answers\". Not only that, the medic that checked on our witness said that it seemed as though his psyche had been totally broken, as he was barely capable of speaking after leading us to that terrifying scenery. Later today, we will release a public statement about the events, but we can't involve the Díaz family, not yet. We need to gather more information to get to the bottom of all this.
